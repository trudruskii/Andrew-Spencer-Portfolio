# Andrew-Spencer-Portfolio
My portfolio site is currently a single page that showcases my current understanding and competency of building a static page using HTML, CSS(TailwindCSS) and Javascript. As my learning expands, I will be adding additional content/pages to my portfolio site to further showcase my full stack technologies and how they are evolving.
